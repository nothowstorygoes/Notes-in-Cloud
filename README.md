    Notes in Cloud is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that leverages the Firebase Web API to store your notes in PDF format. This allows you to access your class notes on any device you need.
The application is developed using React.js, with the Next.js framework serving as the foundation for the front-end. For authentication, it utilizes Firebase Authentication, and for storage, it relies on Firebase Cloud Storage.
